## Introduction
In Flutter app development, effective state management is pivotal for ensuring smooth performance and enhancing the overall user experience. State management revolves around handling two primary types of state: ephemeral state and app state. Understanding these distinctions is essential for structuring Flutter applications efficiently.

## Ephemeral State
Ephemeral state pertains to transient data localized within a specific widget or its subtree. It mainly encompasses UI-related information that doesn't necessitate sharing across different parts of the application. Ephemeral state is typically managed using StatefulWidget and can be modified locally within the widget where it's defined.

An illustrative example of ephemeral state is the default app created with the flutter create command, where setState is employed to modify a counter value, prompting a re-render to reflect UI changes accordingly.

However, a drawback of this approach arises when attempting to share such data across multiple widgets within a complex app structure. For instance, if the app comprises multiple screens, each relying on the same counter variable, facilitating data sharing becomes challenging.[View simple example for Ephemeral State]()

## App State
Conversely, app state refers to the overarching state of the application that necessitates sharing across various widgets or persisting throughout the app's lifecycle. App state commonly embodies data fetched from servers, user authentication status, or application settings configurations.

A classic illustration is a basic Flutter app with multiple screens, where each screen can update the same counter variable. The distinction here is that when the counter value is altered in one screen, the updated value propagates to other screens rather than initializing a new value or resorting to a default one.
